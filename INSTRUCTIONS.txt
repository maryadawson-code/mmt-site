# FIX v2 - Correct Logo Files

The previous white logo files were blank. These are the ACTUAL logos.

---

## STEP 1: Upload these 3 files to GitHub

Upload and REPLACE:
- mmt-logo.png (full logo with text - for hero/footer)
- mmt-logo-nav.png (icon only - for nav bar)
- podcast.html (fixed podcast page)

---

## STEP 2: Fix the CSS

If you added the previous CSS filter code, you need to either:

**Option A (easier):** Add this to the END of styles.css:

```css
/* Remove logo filters */
.nav-logo img,
.nav .logo img,
header .logo img,
.hero-logo img,
.hero-image img,
footer .logo img,
.footer-logo img,
.footer-brand img {
    filter: none !important;
}
```

**Option B:** Find and DELETE any code that starts with:
`/* Logo Fix - Converts white logo to cyan`
or contains `filter: brightness(0) saturate`

---

## STEP 3: Commit, wait 2 min, hard refresh

---

## What you'll see:
- Nav: Shield icon (cyan with subtle glow)
- Hero: Full logo with "MISSION MEETS TECH" text
- Podcast page: Working Transistor embed

The glow effect is baked into these logos - it's not perfect but the logo will actually show now.
